            <h3>Misplaced</h3>
            <p>
                Sometimes I feel so out of time and place,<br>
                Trapped in a maze<br>
                As if I was lost in someone else's life...<br>
                The values I should keep in high regard don't mean a thing to me<br>
                <br>
                Do you ever feel a need to go back in time?<br>
                A dream of mine...<br>
                To travel far away and one day steal back my life<br>
                In the end all I can do is to learn I live in a dreamland<br>
                <br>
                This time was not made for me,<br>
                I have nowhere to land, no place to rest,<br>
                Like a bird, without a nest, I'm gliding<br>
                Under the clouds, forevermore<br>
                <br>
                How much suffocated anxiety can be held within?<br>
                I was found guilty to a crime against myself<br>
                No need to hear the words again,<br>
                I live and I'd die for my dreamland<br>
                <br>
                This time was not made for me,<br>
                I have nowhere to land, no place to rest,<br>
                Like a bird, without a nest, I'm gliding<br>
                Under the clouds, forevermore<br>
                <br>
                I'll never have a chance,<br>
                I can't understand<br>
                I'm a misplaced man<br>
                How could this backward land<br>
                Learn to understand my dance?<br>
                What it's like, when<br>
                Every single smile hurts...<br>
                <br>
                I have never felt like home here<br>
                Always missing something<br>
                People aren't connecting<br>
                Am I a misplaced soul?<br>
                <br>
                I live in a perfect Hell,<br>
                I try finding my wishing well<br>
                When I drop my last tear,<br>
                I have accepted this life<br>
                <br>
                A true saint, that I am not,<br>
                You have never seen me<br>
                'Cause I have always been there,<br>
                Standing by your side<br>
                <br>
                I'll never have a chance,<br>
                I can't understand<br>
                I'm a misplaced man<br>
                How could this backward land<br>
                Learn to understand my dance?<br>
                What it's like, when<br>
                <br>
                Every single moment pains me...<br>
                Never felt like home here<br>
                I am missing something<br>
                My soul's in a wrong shell?
